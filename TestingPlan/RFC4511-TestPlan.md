# LDAP Protocol Security Assessment & Penetration Testing Plan
## Based on RFC 4511 - LDAPv3 Protocol Specification

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive security assessment plan for evaluating the implementation of an LDAP server at the protocol level. The focus is on testing the server's adherence to RFC 4511 specifications, identifying implementation vulnerabilities, and assessing resilience against protocol-level attacks.

---

## Assessment Scope

### In Scope:
- LDAP protocol implementation (RFC 4511)
- ASN.1/BER encoding/decoding mechanisms
- Message layer processing
- All LDAP operations (Bind, Search, Modify, Add, Delete, etc.)
- Control handling
- Extended operations
- Error handling and result codes
- Transport layer (TCP/389)
- TLS/StartTLS implementation (RFC 4513 reference)
- SASL authentication mechanisms

### Out of Scope:
- Directory data/schema validation (covered by RFC 4512)
- Application-level logic
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Network infrastructure

---

## 1. Protocol Encoding & Parsing Tests

### 1.1 ASN.1/BER Encoding Violations

**Objective:** Test server's handling of malformed BER encodings

**Test Cases:**

#### 1.1.1 Length Encoding Attacks
```
- Send indefinite length encoding (should be rejected per RFC)
- Send incorrect length values (too short, too long)
- Send length values exceeding maxInt (2147483647)
- Test 32-bit integer overflow in length fields
- Send length indicating data beyond packet boundary
```

#### 1.1.2 Type Encoding Violations
```
- Send invalid tag numbers
- Use constructed encoding for primitive types (OCTET STRING)
- Use primitive encoding for constructed types (SEQUENCE)
- Send unrecognized APPLICATION tags
- Test extensibility with future/unknown tags
```

#### 1.1.3 Value Encoding Issues
```
- BOOLEAN: Send values other than 0x00 or 0xFF
- INTEGER: Send malformed multi-byte integers
- OCTET STRING: Send with constructed encoding
- ENUMERATED: Send out-of-range values
- Send default values that should be absent
```

**Tools:**
- Custom ASN.1 fuzzer
- PROTOS LDAP test suite (c06-ldapv3)
- Manual packet crafting with scapy/Python

**Expected Results:**
- Server should reject all malformed BER
